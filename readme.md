# CoSchedule clone
We have been learning Full Stack-Web Development at Masai School. I and my team have made this project during the construct week of unit-2 at Masai school. Here is the link of our app live on github [https://bhupesh1114.github.io/group-project-masai/](https://bhupesh1114.github.io/group-project-masai/)

Landing Page

The above picture is of the landing page that is created by Nikhil Mehara which is almost similar to the landing page of CoSchedule. He used HTML and CSS for styling the website


```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
